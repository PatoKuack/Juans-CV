# Juan-CV

## Description.
A web resume inspired by a friend's resume.

- The project is 100% accessible and responsive.
- You can download the CV in pdf.
- An email can be sent directly through the Netlify service.

## Interactivity.
Added notebook animation carousel displaying knowledge
A visual instruction appears indicating that the section can be slid sideways.

### The hardest thing for me was...
Trying to send email from the page using PHP, I had problems with the code in the webpack build and the Netlify implementation, so I decided to use the Netlify service because it was taking too long on the project.
